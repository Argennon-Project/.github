## The Argennon Project

Argennon (*the classical pronunciation should be used:* /ɑrˈɡen.non/) is a cloud based blockchain and smart
contract platform which tries to solve shortcomings of existing platforms. The Argennon blockchain uses a hybrid
proof of stake (HPoS) consensus protocol, which is based on participation of every Argennon user. This hybrid
protocol is able to combine the benefits of a centralized and a decentralized system.

Thanks to the cloud based design of the Argennon blockchain, transaction validation does not require costly
computational resources, and normal personal computers with limited hardware capabilities can actively
participate in the Argennon consensus protocol. This property makes Argennon a truly decentralized and
democratic blockchain and one of the most secure existing platforms.

By using cryptographic accumulators, the integrity of data on the Argennon cloud is guaranteed, and there
is no need for trusting cloud servers. At the same time, by using a smart clustering algorithm the network usage
and the overhead of the commitment scheme is kept manageable.

The Argennon cloud is formed by a permission-less network of Publicly Verifiable Database (PV-DB) servers. A
PV-DB server in Argennon, is a conventional data server which uses its computational and
storage resources to help the Argennon network process transactions. A large portion of incentive rewards in
the Argennon platform is devoted to PV-DB servers. This incentivizes the development of conventional
networking, storage and computational hardware, which can benefit all areas of information technology. This
contrasts with the approach of other blockchains that incentivizes the development of a totally useless technology
of hash calculation.

An initial draft of the Argennon white paper can be
found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aybehrouz/AVM/main/pdf/A.pdf). In addition,
this [link](https://github.com/aybehrouz/argennon#readme) provides a brief overview of the important properties of the Argennon
platform.

Until the launch of the Argennon main-net, an ERC20 token and a governance system will be deployed on the Binance Smart
Chain or the Ethereum network in order to represent investors' share in the project and give them the opportunity to
determine the project's path. After the launch of the Argennon blockchain, this token will be convertible in 1:1 ratio
to the native currency of the Argennon blockchain.
